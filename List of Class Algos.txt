	1. Maximum sum subarray - n
	2. Largest common subsequence - m*n
	3. Longest increasing subsequence - n^2 and nlogn
	
3. Greedy
	1. Input: n jobs for each job weight wi and processing time ti, 
	output: A schedule to minimize sum of weighted completion time ie, wj*cj
	2. Given n intervals, color them st no two intersecting intervals have same color
	Hint: sort by start point
	3. Maximum independent subset of non-intersecting intervals
	Hint: sort by end points, always pick 1st interval
	Variation: on codechef, max arriving guests at any point
