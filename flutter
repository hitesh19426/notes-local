Why flutter:
   Flutter can be used to build android, ios, web and even linux apps simultaneoulsy with just one database. Thats the best part. You make 3/4 app with one database.
   Flutter uses material design (check https://material.io/design), which makes your app looks good which trying.
   It allows you to use OOPs into apps, which helps in structuring of the code.

Basics of Flutter:
   Everything in flutter is a widget, I mean everything. So text, image, container, layout, icon or anything else is a widget.
   Every widget in flutter is represented using a class. So every widget is a class but not vice-versa. You can create a class to store just data, it would not be a widget then.
   Flutter uses dart as a base language, so everything you write is in dart. Flutter just extends it to use different functionalities.

   Flutter builds something called a widget tree. It is nothing but widgets nested inside each other to represent one big screen/layout/widget itself.
   So you can have a icon inside a text, or text inside a icon or button etc. They all form a tree like structure of widgets hence widget tree.

   Each widget has certain properties which you can control to customzise them.

   Use ctrl+Q to see suggestion for any component.

Stateless vs Stateful Widget

Stateless : Stateless widget does not change state/data. It can have data but that data can not be changed. For example a custom styled Text.

Stateful : This type of widget can contain data that changes over time. Maybe like a counter variable which changes when a button is pressed.


Expanded Widgets:
